Each time an object is created using a new() keyword, at least one constructor
 (it could be the default constructor) is invoked to assign 
 initial values to the data members of the same class. 

Types of Constructors in Java

1. Default Constructor in Java
A constructor that has no parameters is known as default constructor

2. Parameterized Constructor in Java
A constructor that has parameters is known as parameterized constructor

3. Copy Constructor in Java
Unlike other constructors copy constructor is passed with another object 
which copies the data available from the passed object to the newly created object.

Even though a subclass inherits all public and protected fields and methods of
the parent class, it does not inherit constructors. However, the subclass can
call a superclassâ€™s constructor using the super() keyword, typically as the
first line of its own constructor.
