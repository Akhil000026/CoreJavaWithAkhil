ar is not a keyword → it’s a reserved type name.

The type is determined at compile time.

Once inferred, it’s fixed → var is not dynamic typing.

✅ Rules
✅ Works only for local variables, like:

Variables in methods

For-loop indices

Try-with-resources

✅ NOT allowed for:

Fields

Method parameters

Method return types
