                       Units of Memory

The first memory location in a computer is bit.
Represents binary values 0 and 1.

The fundamental unit used to measure data is the byte.
It has 8 bits in it. A byte can therefore represent 2 * 8 or 256 values.

              1byte=8 bit

1. boolean Data Type
The boolean data type represents a logical value that can be either true or false.
 Conceptually, it represents a single bit of information, but the actual size 
 used by the virtual machine is implementation-dependent and typically at 
 least one byte (eight bits) in practice

2.. byte Data Type
The byte data type is an 8-bit signed two’s complement integer. 
The byte data type is useful for saving memory in large arrays.

3. short Data Type
The short data type is a 16-bit signed two’s complement integer.
Similar to byte, a short is used when memory savings matter,
especially in large arrays where space is constrained.


                 
                 byte = 1 Bytes
                 short=char=2 Bytes
                 int=float= 4 Bytes
                 long=double=8 Bytes

                 

#float                 v/s                  double 
Precision	    ~6-7 decimal digits	        ~15-16 decimal digits
Default Type	No (you must use f suffix)	Yes (default for decimal numbers)
