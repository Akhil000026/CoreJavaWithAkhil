# Unary Operators
Unary Operators need only one operand. They are used to increment, decrement, or negate a value. 

- , Negates the value.
+ , Indicates a positive value (automatically converts byte, char, or short to int).
++ , Increments by 1.
Post-Increment: Uses value first, then increments.
Pre-Increment: Increments first, then uses value.
-- , Decrements by 1.
Post-Decrement: Uses value first, then decrements.
Pre-Decrement: Decrements first, then uses value.
! , Inverts a boolean value.

5. Logical Operators
Logical Operators are used to perform “logical AND” and “logical OR” 
operations, similar to AND gate and OR gate in digital electronics.
 They have a short-circuiting effect, meaning the second condition is not evaluated if the first is false.

Conditional operators are:

&&, Logical AND: returns true when both conditions are true.
||, Logical OR: returns true if at least one condition is true.
!, Logical NOT: returns true when a condition is false and vice-versa


7. Bitwise Operators
Bitwise Operators are used to perform the manipulation of individual 
bits of a number and with any of the integer types. They are used when 
performing update and query operations of the Binary indexed trees. 
& (Bitwise AND): returns bit-by-bit AND of input values.
| (Bitwise OR): returns bit-by-bit OR of input values.
^ (Bitwise XOR): returns bit-by-bit XOR of input values.
~ (Bitwise Complement): inverts all bits (one’s complement).


. Shift Operators
<< (Left shift): Shifts bits left, filling 0s (multiplies by a power of two).
>> (Signed right shift): Shifts bits right, filling 0s (divides by a power of two), with the leftmost bit depending on the sign.
>>> (Unsigned right shift): Shifts bits right, filling 0s, with the leftmost bit always 0.


9. instanceof Operator
The instanceof operator is used for type checking. 
It can be used to test if an object is an instance of a class, 
a subclass, or an interface. The general format,  

object instance of class/subclass/interface
